The last week has been very exciting for me.
I tweeted about **Morphues** and wrote [some words](https://arnodo.net/2015/01/07/introducing-morpheus) about it and the buzz started pretty fast.

Even though the project is far from its first stable release, I received a lot of questions about it and its state.

> This is the best thing ever for a guy who likes to spend time open-sourcing code :)

Morpheus has been featured on:

- [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/issues/214)
- [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/issues/68)
- [React Rocks](http://react.rocks/example/morpheus)

In these last few days I focused on solving some [issues](https://github.com/vesparny/morpheus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and developing new features.

### RSS

Morpheus has now full RSS support for blog entries, everything works out of the box. Add this [website](https://arnodo.net/rss/) to your feed reader for a try.

## Open Graph

Morpheus supports meta tags for Open Graph.
This means that any of your posts shared on Social Network will now have rich content associated.

### Google Analytics

A custom google analytics component has been added, you can track page visits now, just adding your tracking code in the configuration file.

### Next steps

#### Split the monolith

The much more important thing is to rethink the Morpheus architecture.
The application has now a monolithic structure, and the idea is to split it in some npm modules and give each of them less responsibilities.
This way the core will be easier to be maintained.

#### Yeoman generator

The installation process should be as easy as possible, this is why I'm thinking about creating a Yeoman module for installing Morpheus.

### Help Morpheus

I have a lot of [ideas](https://github.com/vesparny/morpheus/issues), but I've been alone in this adventure so far.

If you want to contribute with ideas or code, you are more than welcome!
